STELLA1 = "Stella: \"So I've been researching injectable estrogen and it's led me down this really deep rabbit hole, I mean I'm scrolling through hundreds of reddit comments now and talking to people on mastodon about this, and I'm still learning new stuff and agonizing over little details.\""
STELLA2 = "Stella: \"Ok so first of all, there are three main esters of estradiol that people typically inject. There's estradiol valerate, which is by far the most common kind prescribed because it's really the only kind manufactured because it's cheap. Very very uncommon to see a prescription for anything else. Valerate is ok, but it has a short half life so it has to be injected frequently and there's really no reason to use it other than logistical availability. Estradiol cypionate has a significantly longer half life in the body, which means when you inject the level of estrogen in your blood doesn't spike as hard, and it decreases slower so you don't have to inject as long. Valerate should be injected every 5 days roughly, but cypionate is fine for every 7. Cypionate is barely produced or prescribed at all, there's exactly one company that makes it in America and they don't make much. Then there's enanthate, my ester of choice, which has quite a long half life, can be injected every 10 days no problem, and allows for very consistent E levels. You can only get enanthate homebrewed, meaning only if people buy the powder wholesale from China or Russia or somewhere, and then mix it themselves with benzoyl alcohol and MCT oil into an injectable solution. I know that sounds dangerous, and it definitely takes practice and care, but there are people who do this (somewhat) professionally, mixing many many vials for trans girls all over the world to order online. Can you imagine that, you can just order injectable estrogen online and have it shipped to you, no prescription or anything, and it's even better than prescription stuff? Well, that's the ideal at least, and often it comes true.\""
STELLA3 = "Stella: \"So I'm thinking I want to switch from valerate to enanthate, but valerate is easy (just pick it up from CVS and inject) whereas enanthate involves buying bitcoin and using the bitcoin to order the enanthate online, then waiting for international shipping. And I'll have to have my friend in the UK forward the package to me, because the people who make the best enanthate right now are based in the UK, and they only ship domestic. So I'll have them send it to her and she'll send it to me and tell customs it's essential oils. That should work, that's how it's usually done. Very unlikely that it would be seized, and it's not a controlled substance so I'm fine even if it is seized.\""
STELLA4 = "Stella: \"Then then next question is how to inject it. Enanthate vials have way higher concentrations of estrogen and thus you don't have to inject nearly as much, only 0.1mL for a full week's dose compared to the 0.4mL I do now. With such a high concentration, waste becomes a much bigger concern than it was previously, so I've decided I'll switch from 1mL syringes with detachable needles, to 0.5mL (or even 0.3mL) insulin syringes with attached needles and extremely low dead space. The detachable needle syringes waste like 0.07mL or something even if I use a technique to reduce that, whereas insulin syringes waste less than 0.01mL. Less than 10 micro-liters. Incredible. But a problem arises: I use an auto-injector, to deal with needle anxiety and get my injections done without too much stress. It's a real lifesaver. But only very specific syringes fit this injector, so I ordered some that didn't fit and now I have 100 0.5mL syringes with tiny needles, otherwise perfect, but I can't use them really. So I went online and I found out, first of all, exactly what syringes actually fit the auto-injector. Then I found where I can buy those without a prescription, because most online pharmacies require a prescription. I could have gotten a prescription from my endocrinologist, but I'd already gotten one for the other syringes and I didn't want to deal with it again. Luckily I was able to order from a supplier not in the US, who didn't have to deal with state laws about requiring prescriptions for syringes and needles. Those laws are there to make it harder to inject heroin, but wow hoo boy they sure do hurt trans people and don't really hurt heroin addicts that much. Just encourages re-using needles, which you should never do. Really pisses me off. Anyways. The syringes arrived and they fit! So now what?\""
STELLA5 = "Stella: \"Now I learn to inject subcutaneous, baby! I've been injecting intramuscular into my thigh for two years, and subcutaneous (injecting into fat, rather than muscle) is the other injection method that trans people use for hormones. Never done it before but a few weeks ago I tried it, and... are you listening? Are you still reading this? I bet you stopped reading this, right. That means I can say whatever I want. Swamp swamp swamp swamp swamp. Tyger tyger burning bright, in the forests of the night. The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog. awawawawa owo uwu ass ass ass i'm not like other girls i'm actually a microwave woowoowoowoowoow   ...  woo\""
